# 🚢 **Dock Systems**

**Roblox ↔ Discord Verification. Alt Detection. REST API Infrastructure.**

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Dock Systems** — a modern identity-linking, verification, and anti-abuse platform built for Roblox communities, Discord servers, and developers who need fast, reliable, and secure account mapping.

Dock powers verification flows, identity linking, alt-detection, developer APIs, and modern administrative dashboards.

## 🔧 **What We Build**

### 🧩 **Verification Platform**

Seamlessly connect Roblox ↔ Discord accounts with real-time sync, automated integrity checks, and customizable onboarding flows.

### 🛰️ **REST Developer API**

A production-grade REST API at **api.docksys.xyz**, featuring:

* Discord → Roblox lookups
* Roblox → Discord lookups
* Linking, unlinking, and update operations
* Premium-only alt-detection endpoints
* Strong authentication and strict rate limits
* Versioned, JSON-based responses

### 🕵️ **Alt Detection Engine**

Dock Premium analyzes hashed login metadata and link history to detect:

* alternate / backup accounts
* shared-device activity
* suspicious login clusters
* abusive behavior patterns

**No raw IPs are stored — only hashed/encrypted metadata.**

### 📊 **Dashboards & Tools**

Modern management dashboards for:

* API key configuration
* login + verification insights
* account-link management
* premium features & billing

Dock follows strict data-handling standards:

* IP metadata is **hashed or encrypted**, never stored raw
* Access is limited to required internal systems only
* No selling, renting, or advertising use of personal data
